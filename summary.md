# ðŸŸ¨ Mission 1: Eyes on the Border (Revised)

## Concept
A routine CAP turns hot when Iraqi MiGs cross the NFZ and engage. This action triggers an immediate, pre-planned SEAD strike by a land-based Hunter/Killer team, tasked with dismantling the SAM site that activates to support the MiGs.

## Briefing
> "All callsigns, listen up. Lancer flight, you have the CAP today. Your F-14s will enforce the No-Fly Zone north of Basra. Be advised, Iraqi posture is aggressive. Panther flight, your F-4E Hunters and F-16C Killers will be on station at a holding point south of the border. If and when the Iraqis engage Lancer, their air defense network will light up. That's your cue. Panther, you will execute an immediate SEAD strike on any active threats to protect Coalition assets. Lancer, draw their fire. Panther, knock out their fangs. Good luck."

## Mission Flow & Key Triggers

### 1. Staging
Lancer flight launches from the carrier and proceeds to its CAP station. Panther flight launches from Al Dhafra and sets up in its holding pattern at WP2.

### 2. The Violation
Once Lancer is on station for 3-5 minutes, the Iraqi MiG-23s are triggered. They fly south across the NFZ line.

### 3. Engagement & SEAD Trigger
- **AWACS ("Magic") calls out the bandits,** declaring them hostile as they cross the line:
  > "Lancer 1, Magic. Multiple bandits, BULLSEYE 010 for 60, hostile. Intercept, weapons free."

- **As soon as the MiG-23s are engaged** by the F-14s (a trigger condition of "missile in zone" or "unit is fired upon"), two things happen simultaneously:
  1. The Iraqi SA-2 site's Fan Song radar activates and attempts to lock the F-14s
  2. AWACS gives the execute order:
     > "Panther flight, Magic. Lancer is engaged. You are cleared to push. I say again, push now. Target is a hot SA-2, callsign 'Anvil,' located west of Basra."

### 4. Hunter/Killer in Action
- **Panther 1 (F-4E)** leads the ingress, using their RWR to find the Fan Song radar. They fire their AGM-45 Shrikes to suppress or destroy the radar emitter.
- **Panther 2 (F-16C)** follows close behind. Once the F-4s call "Magnum!" or "Rifle!" and confirm the radar is down or suppressed, the F-16s roll in to visually acquire and destroy the SA-2 launchers and support vehicles with CBU-87s.

### 5. Resolution
With the MiGs destroyed and the SA-2 site neutralized, all flights receive the call from AWACS to "disengage and return to base." Mission success.
